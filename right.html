        The online examination portal serves as a centralized platform
         for seamless assessment experiences. Upon arriving at the homepage,
          users are greeted with a warm welcome and are presented with 
          essential navigation links to streamline their journey. The portal
           features a robust user authentication system, offering a secure 
           login interface and a user-friendly registration process. The user
            dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of upcoming exams, 
            schedules, and quick links to ongoing assessments, creating a 
            personalized and efficient experience. Administrators can 
            effortlessly create exams through an intuitive interface, 
            configuring various parameters such as duration, question 
            types, and difficulty levels. A rich question bank, categorized 
            by subject and difficulty, facilitates easy selection and 
            modification of questions. The exam-taking interface is designed 
            for clarity, featuring a timer, navigation buttons, and question 
            marking options. Diverse question types, including multiple-choice, 
            true/false, short answer, matching, and fill-in-the-blank, ensure 
            a versatile testing environment.
